## About Me

I'm an American expat who's been in the UK since 2011. My first passion is stories, and while that originally took my down publishing route, I realised that coding is all about stories too. Everything you create in code is trying to tell a story, whether it's the story of your bank balance or the tale of social media.

What excites me about software development is the emphasis on learning - yes, you need to do the work, but a lot of the work is figuring out the stuff. The stuff can be how a web app works, or how to get a random response when you ask a computer a question, or how to get information to persist from one screen to the next. It's always changing! And you have to really think about it.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

Learning new technologies is a key skill of mine, which can be demonstrated through my success at Makers Academy, and in previous jobs. When I started at Bloomsbury, I quickly had to learn how to use Biblio, Collection Point and FocalPoint, three software systems used by the publishing industry. I became especially proficient at using Biblio - so much so that when I moved to Andersen Press, my new colleagues would often come to me for Biblio advice and to help them with Biblio queries.

#### Fabulous communicator

Communication is my jam. At Andersen Press, I worked for two teams which each had different deadlines and priorities. I needed to ensure that each of these teams was talking to each other, as well as with other departments, to make sure that everything ran successfully and on time. This skill was easily translated to coding, and I'm great at talking aloud during my coding process, justifying what I'm doing and explaining what's happening. It's also useful in group projects - not only for deciding on what needs to be done, but also in describing what you've found and teaching it to the rest of the group. It's also handy for when things get a bit awkward between other people, which is a reality in all group projects - I love mediating, and helping people talk out what's happening.

### Organisation and Time Management

My excellent time management and organisation ensured the successful smooth running of all the teams I kept on schedule. A detailed plan including specific tasks and strict deadlines created an essential overview allowing me to manage all projects effectively. During Makers, I have continuously applied this skill set when approaching our Team Projects; creating sprints with planned purposeful tasks and strict deadlines allowed us to be efficient and productive and thus create numerous successful and informative projects.

#### Enthusiastic

I am super enthusiastic - I could try to blame in on being American, but I think it's hardwired into my personality. This means that I can get excited about anything, and maintain that level of excitement for a really long time. It helps me stay mentally engaged in a project, and it can be infectious - one of my SassSquatch teammates once called me 'the happiest person ever', and my mental attitude helped boost the rest of the team. When the coding got difficult, and the pressure of doing our final project started getting to us, my enthusiasm helped buoy up people's spirits, helping us drive through to the end.
