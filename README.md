## Katy Day

I'm an American expat who's been in the UK since 2011. My first passion is stories, and that took me down the path of grad school and working in publishing. Then I realized that I wasn't satisfied doing the same thing over and over again every day, so decided I needed a career change and a new challenge. Welcome coding! It's so engaging being challenged by something and needing to come up with a creative solution - I love working my brain! Coding and tech to me are new ways of telling stories, and I'm so excited to get into this industry.
