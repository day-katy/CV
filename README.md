## Katy Day

I'm an American expat who's been in the UK since 2011. My first passion is stories, and that took me down the path of grad school and working in publishing. Then I realized that I wasn't satisfied doing the same thing over and over again every day, so decided I needed a career change and a new challenge. Welcome coding! It's so engaging being challenged by something and needing to come up with a creative solution - I love working my brain! Coding and tech to me are new ways of telling stories, and I'm so excited to get into this industry.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Fast learner

- When I started at Bloomsbury, I had no idea how to use Biblio, Collection Point or FocalPoint, three software systems used by the publishing industry. I very quickly learned how these systems worked and became especially proficient at using Biblio - so much so that when I moved to Andersen Press, my new colleagues expressed amazement at my Biblio skills.

- Is being a bookworm a hobby? If not, it should be. My hobby = bookworming.
